# OAF-Loan-Collateral-Analysis

## Summary: 
This repository contains the results of an analysis of the use of collateral to repay microloans at One Acre Fund. I designed, piloted, and managed a phone survey to collect the data used in the analysis. This analysis helped team leadership arrive at a consensus on two points.  The first was that collateral usage was mostly positive for clients and the company. The second was that we could pursue low-cost recommendations that came out of the analysis to help clients make wise decisions about how they used collateral. The main benefit of the analysis is that quantified the effect and perception of collateral usage. It provided a basis of facts that team leadership used to end the perennial debate on collateral policy.

## Context:
Collateral Usage for Loan Repayment: One Acre Fund offers microloans to smallscale farmers expecting repayment around the time of crop harvest. All clients must be part of a group with whom they share joint liability. If any member of the group fails to repay their loan then all members of the group are not allowed to receive loans the following season. From anecdotal evidence, we knew that some proportion of client farmers sold livestock and even household items to repay the loan. Even more concerning were complaints from some farmers that they had assets seized as collateral by their loan officer or members of the loan group. However, there was also anecdotal evidence showing clients liked creating 'collateral agreements' in their groups to make sure they could re-enroll in the following season.   

Research Question: Understand how the use of collateral for repayment affects customer experience and retention.
