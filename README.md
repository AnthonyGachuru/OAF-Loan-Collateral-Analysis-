# OAF-Loan-Collateral-Analysis

## Summary: 
This repository contains the results of an analysis of the use of collateral to repay microloans at One Acre Fund. I designed, piloted, and managed a phone survey to collect the data used in the analysis. This analysis helped team leadership arrive at a consensus on two points.  The first was that collateral usage was mostly positive for clients and the company. The second was that we could pursue low-cost recommendations that came out of the analysis to help clients make wise decisions about how they used collateral. The main benefit of the analysis is that quantified the effect and perception of collateral usage. It provided a basis of facts that team leadership used to end the perennial debate on collateral policy.

## Context:
Microfinance Program: The company offers quality seed and fertilizer on loan to smallscale farmers across East Africa. Farmers are enrolled in the program by local loan officers.  Loan officers are usually constrained to recruiting farmers from a 3-5 km radius around their farm. They enroll farmers through social networks from their community.  As a data analyst, I was attached to the Operations team for the Kenya country program. That team was responsible for enrolling farmers and collecting repayment. The country program operates on a yearly cycle that matches the primary planting season in western Kenya where the program initially started.  Each year the Operations team identifies the locations to expand into order to reach the growth goal for the next year.

Research Question: Analyze the method used for selecting the expansion areas in the previous season and determine whether the method was effective at predicting the enrollment performance of the new sites.
